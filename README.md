# Cobol Tutorial Projects

A collection of small projects from various tutorials I completed to gain a better understanding of COBOL.

## Instalation.
There is nothing here to install, but if you really want to run these files on your own machine, most have been compiled into executables.

## Usage
Mostly just for my personal use. 
As noted above this is just for me to gain a firmer grasp on Cobol and to have some more pratice / experiance with it.

## License

There is no lisence. If you want to play with this code, go for it. Have fun!
